    hintfull: is supposed to give a crisp font that aligns well to the
    character-cell grid but at the cost of its proper shape.
    hintmedium: poorly documented, maybe a synonym for hintfull.
    hintslight is the default: - supposed to be more fuzzy but retains shape.
    
    hintnone: seems to turn hinting off.
    The variations are marginal and results vary with different fonts -->
